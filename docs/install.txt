How to install Testimonials
=========================

Testimonials is installed as a regular ImpressCMS module, which means you should copy the complete /testimonials folder into the /modules directory of your website. Then, log in to your site as administrator, go to System Admin > Modules, look for the Testimonials icon in the list of uninstalled modules and click in the install icon. Follow the directions in the screen and you'll be ready to go.

PLEASE NOTE
-----------

The only part of the module visible from the user side is the random testimonials block. You need to edit the block options to make it visible and accessible to user groups in order to use the module.
